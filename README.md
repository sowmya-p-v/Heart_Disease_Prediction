# Heart_Disease_Prediction
ðŸ¤– Practical Experience with Machine Learning
 -  Developed a machine learning model for heart disease prediction based on health metrics and medical history.
 -  Implemented three types of classification classifiers such as KNN, Bernoulli Naive-Bayes and SVC.
 -  Evaluated its performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix and displayed confusionMatrixDisplay.
