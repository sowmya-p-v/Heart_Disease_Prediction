# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on their health metrics and medical history. Heart disease is a prevalent and serious health condition, and early prediction can lead to timely interventions and better outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health metrics and medical history attributes of individuals, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. 

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Encoding categorical variables
   
### 2. Model Development
   - Implemented three classification models using three different classifiers:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Bernoulli Naive-Bayes
     - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   
### 3. Model Evaluation
   - Performance metrics used:
     - Accuracy
     - Confusion Matrix
   - Utilized confusionMatrixDisplay to visualize confusion matrices.
